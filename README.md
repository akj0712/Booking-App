Since I have deployed the backend on free-plan of [render](https://render.com/). Web Services on the free plan are automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. This can cause a response delay of up to 30 seconds for the first request that comes in after a period of inactivity. So users are requested to please have some patience for the first request after that it's going to be a buttery smooth ride.

## Introduction üëã

It is a Booking app personal project made using React as a frontend, Node and Express for backend and MongoDB as a database. Google Firebase to store all image and video files and generate URL to store it in the database. JWT for registering and login of the user.
Admin section enable the admin of the project of a graphical interface to perform api operation such as adding/deleting movies, series, users and genrating and list and provides a complete overview of the app. I have used this [template](https://github.com/safak/youtube2022/tree/react-admin) to start with.
